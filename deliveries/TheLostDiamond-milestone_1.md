**Additional Information**

The Lost Diamond No.7 video has over 50.000 views and completes the seven deliverables in the ENF Grant Framework Milestone number 1. 

During the two months Milestone period:
- 8 users have been hunting The Lost Diamond. 
- Three users have paid the $7 dollar monthly subscription fee. 
- 30 videos have been published.
- there is a 52% increase in subscribers (from 38 - 58).
- But the most important one - 69.2% average percentage viewed - indicates that The Lost Diamond treasure hunt content is performing extremely well -

with a golden thread: “The EOS blockchain can send money to anyone in the world in less than three seconds. And with a VISA-card from Coinbase, you can spend that money in your local store just a few minutes later.”

Milestone 1 — Prove that TheLostDiamond MVP can get a baseline of 100 participants and obtain a 22% monthly growth rate (2 months duration).

Turns out - after a lot of testing - that was not possible to achieve on the lost diamond conceptual model for 2022.

Getting people to pay a $7 dollar monthly subscription on a poorly-designed MVP, to find ONE secret diamond among 500 checkpoints, using an unknown Anchor sign-in-process -  without a social media host that is explaining what this is all about - was close to impossible. And also - to be part of the Pomelo crowdfunding platform- The Lost Diamond was required to have a free tier - to keep the lost diamond free to use for everyone.   

The Lost Diamond conceptual model for 2022 needed a major reconstruction to be successful before I could start using the $10,000 grant.

I spent the whole summer of 2022 analyzing other successful business models. I spent time with the test group to identify the bottlenecks and what functionality was missing to keep them interested. I spent time learning how to make better YouTube-videos. And all I learned during that process has been refined in reconstructing the new Lost Diamond conceptual model 2023, creating a new and better business model and a new strategy to onboard users to the lost diamond and the EOS ecosystem. 

The most important improvements that has been added is:  

- A free-tier. It is now free to conquer one checkpoint per day.
- I added additional gems and surprises in addition to The Lost Diamond, to make the game more interesting.
- I have lowered the level of finding the lost diamond - now, when a user has conquered ten checkpoints, the location of The Lost Diamond will be revealed to that user.
- A checkpoint caretaker - as a - YouTube-game-host character is added to the game. To explain what it’s all about and to be a kind and generous competitor for other players hunting the lost diamond.
- Some low level checkpoints like secret codes on statues, can be solved without getting outdoors. (That creates more engagement from users all over the world)
- I have added a reward to the user who knows the location of the lost diamond first. So if a person knows where the diamond is, but is too far away to get it, that user will get 10% of the diamond’s value when the diamond is conquered by someone else.
- A stable connection to EOS endpoints has been a repeating problem. Causing an error when users are conquering a checkpoint. That has been solved by having an internal pool of endpoints, that is continuously checked for connection time and connection errors.

The new business model is inspired by MrBeast’s business model - where income from YouTube monetization and sponsorships are given back to the viewers.  Only we can do it better, by utilizing the EOS blockchain, TheLostDiamond can send money to anyone in the world in less than three seconds.

As a conclusion on Milestone 1: After research and testing during the past nine months, a reconstruction of the The Lost Diamond conceptual model was needed.
From being a pure monthly subscription based game that did not have enough interesting parts for the customer - It has become a YouTube-GameFi-show, with more entertaining elements, with an improved business model that better reflects the different opportunities. And potentially being even a better influencer for the EOS ecosystem.

Still, the problem is that The Lost Diamond MVP does not have a good user experience. 
50 unique people have started the step for sign-in-with-anchor, but aborted when it gets too complicated.
The Lost Diamond needs to deliver a high-quality user experience to be able to onboard users. 

A solution for this is presented in the linked video in the Context-section. And will be Milestone 2. 

By this, I consider Milestone 1 to be accomplished.
